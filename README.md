# PiDP-8-sim
A PDP-8 simulator for the Raspberry Pi aimed at running efficiently on the A+ model and working with the PiDP8 kit.

## Updating

It has been quite a while since I've worked on this project, and there
have been a lot of changes to C++ compilers and programming techniques.
Now that I have time to work on this again, it is time to refactor
the code to employ modern techniques.
