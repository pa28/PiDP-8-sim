Instructions for building and installing.

1. Fetch source code from the git repository:

git clone git@github.com:pa28/PiDP-8-sim.git
cd PiDP-8-sim

2. Install prerequisites.

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

3. Edit recurse.mk to set variables as appropriate. The main ones to look at are:

  - ROOT_DIR
  - BIN_DIR
  - ETC_DIR

4. Build

make

5. Install

sudo make install 

6. Running. The program will be configured to start on boot and stop on shutdown. You
may start it or stop it manually with the service command:

sudo service rc.pidp8 start
sudo service rc.pidp8 stop

You may also use the panel shutdown command. Select both "Sing Step" and "Sing Inst" on
(down), then activate the "Stop" switch and hold for aproximately 8 seconds as the
countdown progresses. Once the countdown is complete the program will exit and the 
Raspberry Pi will shutdown. Releasing the "Stop" switch aborts the countdown.
